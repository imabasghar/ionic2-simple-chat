# Ionic 2: Alpha

Ionic 2 is the next generation of [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), the open-source mobile app development SDK that makes it easy to build top quality mobile apps with web technologies.

Ionic 2 is based on the new [2.x version of AngularJS](https://angular.io/), and comes with many significant performance, usability, and feature improvements.
